  is not new enough. Contributed by Chris Billington.

  `labscript_utils.h5_lock`. Contributed by Chris Billington
  ([PR #90](https://bitucket.org/labscript_suite/labscript_utils/pull_requests/90))

- Improve help text of `labscript_utils.winlauncher` to show how to run modules as well
  as scripts. Contributed by Chris Billington.
  ([PR #91](https://bitucket.org/labscript_suite/labscript_utils/pull_requests/91))
